## 🔧 Pre-Seeding Checklist

- [ ] **Database backup created**
- [ ] **Production environment verified**
- [ ] **Database credentials configured**
- [ ] **Laravel application deployed**
- [ ] **Tested in staging environment**

## 🚨 Safety Features

### ✅ Safe for Production
- Uses `updateOrCreate()` to prevent duplicates
- Won't overwrite existing data
- Creates database backup before seeding
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging and verification

### ✅ Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Restore from backup: `mysql -u user -p database < backup_file.sql`
2. Or run: `php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1`

## 📈 Verification Commands

After seeding, verify with:
```bash
# Check counts
php artisan tinker --execute="
echo 'Departments: ' . App\Models\GlobalDepartment::count();
echo 'Locations: ' . App\Models\GlobalLocation::count();
"

# Check specific data
php artisan tinker --execute="
App\Models\GlobalDepartment::where('is_active', true)->get(['name', 'code']);
App\Models\GlobalLocation::where('is_active', true)->get(['name', 'city', 'country']);
"
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

After successful seeding:
- **20 Global Departments** with codes and descriptions
- **30 Global Locations** with cities, states, countries, and timezones
- All records marked as `is_active = true`
- No duplicate entries
- Database backup created

## 📞 Support
